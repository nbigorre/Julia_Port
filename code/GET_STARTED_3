+  HAVING MORE CONTROL
+----------------------------------------

Here are some procedures you might want to follow in order to run your own simulations.

************
* Important: whether you are a user or a developer, you are strongly invited not to modify the files contained in code/model/ . 
  This directory is designed to contain the latest version of the model, which is common to every user at a given time.
  It is henceforth advisable to follow the steps described in "case 0" to modify the model according to your needs.
************


-------
CASE 1: You do not want to use netcdf output:

  By default, both binary and netcdf outputs are created. If you wish not to use netcdf and do not want to install netcdf libraries, follow these steps:

  - edit the file ./expe_folder/inc/cppdef.jl and set the output_netcdf variable to false: 
          global const file_output_cdf = true     -by default
          global const file_output_cdf = false    -if you do not want to use netcdf.

-------
CASE 2: You do not want to use the superceding trick:

  Simply use " sh tools/compile_julia.sh " without any argument. The call to compile will simply build the standard version of the model.

-------
CASE 3: You want to change the grid size.

  step 1: Edit model/inc/size.jl (preproc is no yet implemented use know valid values to run)

  step 2: Compile and run.

CASE 4: You want to change the julia arguments.

  4.a: Pass additional arguments to the julia_launch script (ex: ./julia_launch.sh nh namelist --check-bounds=no)

  4.b: Edit the julia_lauch script to add arguments in the julia_options variable.
